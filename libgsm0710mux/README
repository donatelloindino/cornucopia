libgsm0710mux
=============

This library supports implementing a GSM 07.10 Multiplexing Server.
It requires libgsm0710 for the protocol engine and glib.

You may either write standalone programs (e.g. communicating over dbus
and using ptys) or embed the library in your GSM server to improve
performance.

Here's why using ptys is bad:
=============================
Hardware -> Kernel -> Userland (07.10) -> Kernel (pty) -> Userland (GSM Server)-> UI

Every '->' involves context switches and copying data around.

The recommended way of using this library is to embed it in your GSM server:

Hardware -> Kernel -> Userland (07.10 + GSM Server) -> UI

(Yes, eventually it would be useful to have 07.10 multiplexing directly in the
kernel. But until this happens, the aforementioned sequence is the best
we have).
