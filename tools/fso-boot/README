 fso-boot: a legacy-free minimal system initializer for modern systems
=======================================================================

fso-boot is an attempt to a) minimize userland boot time and b) get rid
of the full-fledged init system, which we usually don't need for smartphones.

Things like sysvinit, udev, hal, and friends are having a negative impact
and are overkill for modern dbus-based service architectures. If I boot a
Linux-based smartphone, I don't want any
* runlevels
* initscripts
* inittab
* udev and friends.

fso-boot can be used as init process replacement. On startup, it does:

1.) mounts the most important filesystems, such as /proc, /dev/pts, etc.
2.) brings up local networking (lo, usb0/eth0)
3.) launches the dbus system daemon
4.) (optionally) starts a user session, i.e. X11, Framebuffer, etc.

This reduces the enormous complexity, but of course comes with a price
of (very) limited flexiblity. Where exactly we will draw the line has not
been decided yet, the first phase of this project is merely a proof of
concept to see how fast we can actually get.
