    /**
     * Marker interface for unit tests.
     *
     * To define a test suite, imlement this interface.
     * The runner will execute all methods whose names begin with "test_"
     * in that class, each on a separate instance.
     *
     * The set_up() method will be called before each test and
     * tear_down() will be called after. Since each test is run on
     * a separate instance, you can use construct block and destructor
     * with the same effect.
     *
     * [[warning:
     *   The constructor will ++not++ be called, because the object will
     *   be constructed using GLib.Object.newv. You have to use the
     *   //construct// block.
     * ]]
     *
     * Example:
     * {{{
     * class Test1 : Object, FsoTest.Fixture
     * {
     *     construct
     *     {
     *         stdout.printf ("Constructing fixture");
     *     }
     *
     *     ~Test1
     *     {
     *         stdout.printf ("Destroying fixture");
     *     }
     *
     *     public void test_1 ()
     *     {
     *         assert (0 != 1);
     *     }
     * }
     * }}}
     *
     * Test method declared async are also recognized and they are run under
     * main-loop until completion or timeout, which is taken from the
     * //timeout// property. Async test method can optionally have
     * a GLib.Cancellable argument, which will be cancelled when timeout
     * occurs.
     *
     * If you define some public constructible properties and for each
     * property define a static method named
     * "generate_"//property-name// returning a ValueArray, each test
     * will be called once for each value in the returned array. If you
     * define multiple property-generator pairs, the tests will be run
     * for each combination.
