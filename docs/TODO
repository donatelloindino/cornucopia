==libfsobasics==
* add SmartKeyFile.pathValue( section, key, constraints, defaultpath ) querying for a path from the configuration, 
  checking several whether the constraints are met; if not, return the default.
* make read/write a bit more flexible
** read/write: sometimes it should not complain, if there is no file
** read: sometimes it should just return a default string, if there is no file

==libfsotransport==
* More unit tests, add a MockTransport
* Find out how to make sure that we always read what's available from a transport before attempting to write.

==libgsm0710mux==
* Consider a threading model

==fsotdld==
===alarm===
* Should we support a customizable object path for alarm notifications?
* Should registered alarms be persistent in case the daemon dies or the system gets rebooted?
===source_ntp===
* Listen for default route changes; then trigger sync
* Sync regularly (configurable frequency)

==fsousaged==
* Suspend/Resume resources in parallel
* Intermediate Resume Tasks

==fsodeviced==
===Multiple plugins===
* Apply split into device-independent part and device-specific part, i.e.
  such as done with accelerometer could also be handy for vibrator, brightness, etc.

==fsogsmd==
===General===
* Remember certain parameters (i.e. GSM timezone) and augment GSM.Network.Status() signal and method
* Open/Close logic is suboptimal; it would be better to remove channels on shutdown and install them
  on startup, i.e. _not_ in the object constructor
===Error Handling===
* Retry commands upon certain (well-defined) error results, i.e.
  +CMS ERROR 314 (SIM busy)
