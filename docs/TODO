==libfsobasics==
* add SmartKeyFile.pathValue( section, key, constraints, defaultpath ) querying for a path from the configuration,
  checking several whether the constraints are met; if not, return the default.
* make read/write a bit more flexible
** read/write: sometimes it should not complain, if there is no file
** read: sometimes it should just return a default string, if there is no file

==libfsotransport==
* More unit tests, add a MockTransport
* Find out how to make sure that we always read what's available from a transport before attempting to write.

==libgsm0710mux==
* Consider a threading model

==fsotdld==
===alarm===
* Should we support a customizable object path for alarm notifications?
* Should registered alarms be persistent in case the daemon dies or the system gets rebooted?

==fsousaged==
* Suspend/Resume resources in parallel
* Intermediate Resume Tasks

==fsodeviced==
===Multiple plugins===
* Apply split into device-independent part and device-specific part, i.e.
  such as done with accelerometer could also be handy for vibrator, brightness, etc.

==fsogsmd==
===General===
* Remember certain parameters (i.e. GSM timezone) and augment GSM.Network.Status() signal and method
* Open/Close logic is suboptimal; it would be better to remove channels on shutdown and install them
  on startup, i.e. _not_ in the object constructor
===Error Handling===
* Retry commands upon certain (well-defined) error results, i.e.
  +CMS ERROR 314 (SIM busy)
===SMS===
* When attempting to send an SMS:
  If we are not registered, we may receive an error instead of the continuation characters.
  This will trigger an assertion in the At parser which we need to take fix!
  Alternatively, make sure that we never attempt to actually send, when we are not registered.
* Store last reference number in persistent configuration
* Improve support for binary SMS, i.e. WAP PUSH and WBXML configuration messages
* Add support for a) plugins or b) agents
