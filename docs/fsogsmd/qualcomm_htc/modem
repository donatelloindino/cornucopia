== Qualcomm HTC modem specific notes ==

=== Behaviour ===

* Modem starts out with V0, ATZ resets to V0, be careful with your parser.

* Modem responds with +CME ERROR 10 (SIM not inserted), if you query for PIN before +CFUN=1

* Range for +CLVL is 0-5

* Modem automatically tries to attach to PDP contexts

* Modem is a multiband 3G/WCDMA modem, by default it will look for both systems and emit
[WCDMA] URCs. It might be possible to set the mode via +BANDSET

=== GSM standards violations ===

* Even after setting V1, +CME ERRORS are not correctly terminated with \r\n, but only \r

* \r\n missing before SMS continuation character is sent

* International SMS do not accept numbers of the form +4969... you need to substitute the '+' w/ 00
