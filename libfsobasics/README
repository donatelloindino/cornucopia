libfsobasics is a generic glib-2.0-based utility library.

It has been written Vala which compiles to C and has very
few dependencies.

It contains classes for
 * logging
 * configuration
 * process watching
 * sync / async operations
 * inotify watching
 * netlink watching
 * kobject watching
 
While being used primarily for the freesmartphone.org project,
it is versatile enough to be of use for many 3rd party projects.

If you feel there is something missing or want to report a bug,
