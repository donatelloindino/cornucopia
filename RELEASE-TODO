version 0.13
=====================================================================

* fsogsmd:
    * emergency calls
    * homezone API
        * needed anymore?
    * voice mails API
    * send generic/retricted SIM command
    * lockdown feature
        * it should be possible for a client to lock the whole modem for any access.
          Until the lock is set no other client than the one aquired the lock should be
          able to access the modem. If the lock is released other clients can access the
          modem again. Usable for doing firmware upgrade where no other program should be
          allowed to use the modem.
    * cover more API areas with our integration tests
    * mock variant of our modem class to do real unit tests for handlers and mediators
    * merge morphis/device-status?
