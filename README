This is the Vala/C reference implementation of the freesmartphone.org APIs,
codename 'Cornucopia'.

We build up on the concepts of the successful Python reference implementation
and improve this incarnation based on the lessons learned while developing
frameworkd.

The main objectives for this new implementation are (in order of importance)

1.) Full unit test coverage
2.) Minimizing system resources
3.) Maximizing system performance
4.) Improved granularity / standaloneness of services

We will start with implementing fsodeviced, implementing the FSO APIs
org.freesmartphone.Device.*, basing on the results of the odeviced
project from Google Summer of Code 2008.

Tentative roadmap:

fsodeviced: Q2/2009
fsousaged: Q2/2009

... misc. subsystems ...

fsogpsd: Q3/2009
fsogsmd: Q4/2009

NOTE: The existence of this project does NOT mean that
frameworkd is abandoned nor that most of new work is
going into cornucopia. On the contrary, we will continue
stabilizing frameworkd and fixing its bugs.

The python implementation is the chance for getting the API
right; the vala implementation is the chance of getting the
right API fast.
